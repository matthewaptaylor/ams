===============
      MVP
===============
Budgets
Better autosave search algorithm
Make view only users work
Run lighthouse
Make universal dialog component
Deadline emails
Run through caniuse/polyfills
Prevent abuse with App Check firebase
Convert firestore/everything else to production mode
Test on other browsers
Address security vulnerabilities
Stop navigation away from page if something is still submitting
Autosave table, if edit while saving, registers as being up to date

===============
  Minor Fixes
===============
Warning if default AL info/ contact info isn't set
Autosave aif numbers when 0 keep on loading firefox
Scrollbar for firefox and edge
Ensure firestore client/frontend web sdk can't be accessed by anyone - security risk
Press enter to open dialog when tabbed onto date picker, or even when focused
Implement ma of 100 users because firebase.auth.getusers has max of 100?
Stop context menu appearing on installed app on long tap
XSS vulnerabilities in date stored in firestore and other firebase auth things like displayname
Click sign out button if not connected to server
Make sure database rules are set correctly and are secure
Use v-avatar instead of the module that generates avatars
When checking if error == "internal", should it be error == "INTERNAL"?
What happens to a user's activities if they delete their account? PoepleByUid moved to peoplebyemail is a bad idea
Signature server time zone wrong with new Date()

===============
   Better UX
===============
Sticky/always visible sidebar when scrolling on desktop
Delete activities
Preload fonts and images
Chunk vendors to only load needed views initially
Pull to refresh
Implement reload page/get data from server again (refresh icon button that appears in sidebar item? What about desktop nav?)
Organise activities by date
Search for activities
If redirected to login, redirect to correct page after login. Do the same with reauthentication, so we can enable email link reauth?
Implement webpage html title changing
transition on v-if for autosave
Use email link for reauthentication
Test all functions, vulnerabilities, make sure dates are valid, etc
All dropdowns/menu appear below select input field
Skeleton loaders for autosave don't line up, look at AccountProfile
Combobox autosave enter key
Can still go on AIF or RAMS page if disabled

===============
 Nice Features
===============
v-autocomplete for searching emails to change activity leader
Dark mode
Swipe between views on mobile e.g. swipe left to get from overview to plan
Toggle sidebar size
